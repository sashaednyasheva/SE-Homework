DOCTOR WHO'S POLICE BOX

Doctor Who's Police Box is a T.A.R.D.I.S (Time and Relative Dimension In Space), a fantastical space ship that can fly through time and space and other mind-bending-ly impossible situations. It can go anywhere.

Help the T.A.R.D.I.S. navigate through a React App in the form of an object.
