# Hooks Login Project

- Using Hooks, make a login page with a form and inputs
- Check against hardcoded credentials (username, password) in the state
- When the credentials match, render a Welcome/Success component with the message saying "Welcome <username>"
- If the credentials fail, render a Failure component saying "Invalid username or password"
- Should have three components (Form, Welcome/Success, Failure)
