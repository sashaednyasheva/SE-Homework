# React Groceries App

Build an app that let's you make a list of groceries to buy.

Objectives:
- Practice using state or props
- Practice rendering a list
- Practice conditional rendering

Deliverables:
1. Make an array of 3 objects using the above example and render the item, quantity and units (12 pack, 1lb, 2 liters, etc.)
2. Make inputs so that new items can be added
3. Conditionally render the grocery items based on whether or not they were purchased (ok to have hard coded values for isPurchased)
4. Add a button that says 'remove' and when clicked the value of isPurchased is toggled
