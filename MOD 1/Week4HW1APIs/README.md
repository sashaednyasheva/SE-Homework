# Dougie the Donut & Pizza Rat The App
 
Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Users should be able to see five buttons for the five boroughs (manhattan, brooklyn, queens, staten island, bronx) of New York City when they load the page
- Users should also be able to see an input box where they can put in a number of how many complaints they want to see
- When the user clicks on one of the five buttons, a list of complaints should be displayed on the page, according to the number they input AND the borough they clicked on
- If the user doesn't input any number, make the default be 10
- Remember, also, they only want complaints that were handled by the NYPD! (hint: consider filtering for a specific "agency" when making the API call)
- When the list of complaints is shown, each complaint should also have a button on it that reads something along the lines of "toggle police response"
- When the user clicks on on the "toggle police response" button, it should then toggle how the police responded to that particular complaint
- Make sure it only toggles the response for that one complaint, not the entire list!
