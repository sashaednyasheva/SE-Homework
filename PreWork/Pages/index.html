<h1>Hello, Cohort #6!</h1>

<h3>Nice to meet you all!</h3>

<p id="maintext">I would like to introduce myself and tell you a little bit about my name and it's origin.
Sasha is a nickname for Alexandra. From the Greek language Alexandra means "protector and defender". 
I was called after my grandmother. In Russia - where I am originally from - this name can be used for both men and women.
</p>
<p id="text2">I live in New York and I enjoy living in this amazing city. I think that each person wants to visit NY at some point of their life.
